# 📊 Mapping COVID-19: Data Analysis with SQL and Python

## 🎯 About the Project
This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the impact of COVID-19, focusing specifically on the **Lombardy region (Italy)**, identified as one of the critical epicenters.

The challenge involved integrating **Cloud Computing (BigQuery)** tools with **Programming (Python)** to extract, clean, and visualize public health data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Google BigQuery (SQL):** For querying, filtering, and aggregating large datasets.
* **Python (Pandas):** For data ingestion and DataFrame manipulation.
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization and time-series plotting.
* **Google Colab:** Development environment.

## 💡 Key Insights
* **Epicenter Identification:** Through aggregation queries, **Lombardy** was confirmed as the region with the highest accumulated volume of cases.
* **Temporal Analysis (S-Curve):** Time-series visualization allowed for the identification of the disease's growth behavior, highlighting the months of critical acceleration.

## 🚀 How to Run
The complete code is available in the `.ipynb` file within this repository.
1.  The notebook connects to the Google BigQuery API.
2.  Executes the SQL query directly in the cloud.
3.  Generates the visualization chart.
